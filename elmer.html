                Hi Phillip,<br> <br>
                In case you don't recognize my name, it's Haley Cooper-Cox, Dale's daughter.
                I had to hunt down your email address which is why you haven't heard from me sooner.
                We are all very sorry to hear about Elmer. My dad, my brother, Casey and I are all heartbroken.
                Your brother has a very special place in our hearts and our lives. I have some pictures I want
                to email you from my wedding (I will have to do that from my computer at home).
                I was truly touched that Elmer made it up hear for that. He helped out tremendously behind the
                scenes too. Casey and I closed on our house the day before our wedding and so my dad and Elmer
                moved our bed in so we could stay there on our wedding night. After the wedding and the reception
                were over and we went to our new house, and of course I had plenty of champagne at the reception,
                but we had no toilet paper for me to go pee. So your brother saved the day. He rode one of my dad's
                motorcycles down to our house in the rain to deliver us toilet paper.

                He would call us often to check in and see how everyone was doing. We were hoping to get him out this
                way for Thanksgiving but he was just too busy. He thought he might be able to make it before he moved
                back to South Africa.

                We offer our deepest sympathies and our greatest respect. We know how had it is to lose a loved one.
                Elmer is truly loved and will be deeply missed. If you are ever in the country, we would love to see
                you again. You are always a welcome part of our family. <br> <br>

                Take care and much love, <br>

            <p>Beste Philip,<br> <br>
                Ons is 'n Suid-Afrikaanse gesin wat in Marokko woonagtig is.
                Eerstens wil ons ons medelye en innige simpatie betuig aan julle almal met hierdie tragiese afsterwe van
                Elmer.
                Dit is 'n groot slag en alles het so onverwags gebeur. Aanvaar dus hiermee ons innige meegevoel met
                julle as gesin.
                Alhoewel ons nie vir Elmer geken het nie, het ons steeds 'n baie aangename gesprek met hom gehad aan die
                einde van
                Stage 3, net nadat hulle van Nador naby Errachidia (Tilsinnt) geeindig het. Ek het ook enkele fotos
                geneem. Hy was
                baie opgewonde oor sy prestasie en het dadelik sy VSA mederyer geluk gewens met sy mooi prestasie.
                Die volgende oggend het ons hom ook afgesien by die wegspringpunt by Rissani, begin van Stage 4.
                Ek is jammer dat ons nou eers kontak maak, maar, ons het sopas julle webadres aanlyn in die Beeld
                gelees.
                Ek heg hierby die fotos aan. Hoop dit is aangename herinneringe vir julle.
                Laastens wil ek vir julle as gesin baie sterkte toewens in hierdie tyd van rou. Mag ons Hemelse Vader
                deur die krag
                van die Heilige Gees, persoonlik by julle elkeen wees. Mag Hy julle vertroos en vir julle Sy rus en
                vrede gee, daardie
                vrede wat ons verstand te bowe gaan.Philippians 4:7 And God's peace, which is far beyond human
                understanding, will keep
                your hearts and minds safe in union with Christ Jesus. Mag die Skrif uit Romeine 8:28 vir jul ook
                versterk:
                Romans 8:28 We know that in all things God works for good with those who love him, those whom he has
                called according to his purpose. <br> <br>

                Baie seen vir julle. <br>

            <p>Dear Phillip, Jualeen and Family. <br> <br>
                As a friend of Elmer I just want to sympathies to you all.
                We all knew he was a great person, and we will miss him a lot.
                But I've peace in my heart and know God needed him much more than we do.
                I know we all ask why Elmer, but we must remember God came to take us
                on our peack time. And I know at that moment Elmer was the happiest person.
                So I hope you will also find peace and understanding. And remember if any
                of you need a helping hand or someone to talk to just let me know. Because
                Elmer would have done the same for me. <br> <br>

                Regards <br>

            <p> Philip, <br> <br>
                I wanted you to know that I'm thinking about you and your family and that you are
                in my prayers. Elmer was an excellent person and will be sorely missed by all who
                knew him. He had a focus, a drive, and perseverance that I have never known in another
                person. It was inspiring. I feel better for having known him and I know that I'm not
                the only person that he inspired. That is a good legacy to leave behind. It was an
                honor to be his friend as it is to be yours. Know that between Troy and myself you
                always have a home here in America. <br> <br>

                God Bless You, <br>

            <p>Hello Philip & Jualeen and the rest of the family (whom we have not yet met) <br> <br>
                We are battling to find the right words at the moment, nothing but time is
                going to ease the tremendous pain being felt by all. I have not experienced
                emotions like this since my Father's murder in 1998 and through that experience,
                I think that I can understand & share some of your pain. Jonno and I cannot stop
                thinking about you and your family and all I want to do is give you a big hug and
                tell you that we love you. <br>

                Elmer and you were so much in our thoughts over the Roof last year we missed you guys tons.
                I asked a biker who came in for lunch if Elmer was riding, hoping that at the last minute
                he had decided to pop over, and in hearing that Elmer was going to do the Dakar we felt
                an enormous sense of pride for Elmer, a guy who stops at nothing to reach for his dreams
                (and who simply kicks butt!!!). <br>

                With the Dakar starting on my birthday, Jonno and I knew that you guys were out there
                somewhere, and in hearing about Elmer's death on the radio driving back from Maseru we have
                been in a complete state of shock and disbelief!!! The last few days have been a complete
                blurr, with emotions ranging with shock, denial, sadness and immense anger to knowing that
                one day we will accept that Elmer died doing what he is passionate about. <br>

                I went back to a diary from 2001 where I knew Elmer had given me his sister's fax number
                not even a name, clinging to that thought I've been trying to put something down on paper
                to send through - and then I remembered Elmer telling me about his website. Out here despite
                now having telephones and email (no fax lines as yet) we still seem lost in the world of
                technology and it only dawned on me this morning that I could reach you this way. <br>

                Philip, the last time you guys were in Semonkong we had one of the happiest and most chilled
                out days ever! May you and your family repeat that when ever you need some mountain air, at
                any time of day or night you know there is always a bed for you here. Despite the fact we see
                each other in a blue moon or two, we consider you guys as true friends and will always feel Elmer's
                spirit out here in the mountains. <br>

                May each new day help heal a wee bit more and if there is anything at all that you need doing, we are
                at last only a phone call away. You are all continually in our thoughts and prayers, and may these words
                help you in the way it helped me. <br> <br>

                Death is nothing at all. <br>
                I have only slipped away into the next room. <br>
                I am I, and you are you. <br>
                Whatever we were to each other, that we still are. <br>
                Call me by my old familiar name, <br>
                Speak to me in the easy way which you always used. <br>
                Put no difference in your tone, <br>
                Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. <br>
                Laugh as we always laughed, <br>
                At the little jokes we enjoyed together. <br>
                Pray, smile, think of me, pray for me. <br>
                Let my name be ever the household word. <br>
                It always was, let it be spoken without effect, <br>
                Without the trace of a shadow on it. <br>
                Life means all that it ever meant. <br>
                It is the same as it ever was; <br>
                There is unbroken continuity. <br>
                Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? <br>
                I am waiting for you, for an interval, <br>
                Somewhere very near, just round the corner. <br>
                All is well. <br> <br>
                Henry Scott Holland (1847 - 1918) <br> <br> <br>

            <p>Philip, Jauleen, Eileen and your family, James and your family: <br> <br>

                I am so sorry for your loss. Having to say good-bye to Elmer prematurely does not seem fair.
                I know you must be deeply greiving. I will continue to pray that the Lord God will comfort you,
                give you peace and acceptance. I understand no words could express enough, my grief for you, his
                family whom he loved so much and whom obviously loved their baby brother beyond words. I could
                see it in his eyes when he spoke of each of you. Eileen he told me how proud he was of you; how
                "cool" you were. How hard you worked to get where you are. Jauleen, when I asked Elmer what you
                were like he said you were and "awesome girl; good for Philip". Philip, without a doubt he loved,
                admired and did see you as his Hero in life! What a special bond. Elmer was a good man. A gentle
                spirit. It is clear the work ethic and fine character that your parents and yourselves instilled
                in him. Philip, my mother so appreciated your sharing with her about your mother. She tells the
                story of your mothers "charge" to you to "take care of Elmer" with such affection and great admiration.
                We all can see that you did just that. My mother was so touched by Elmer, he was sweet to her and she
                loved him very much. She is so distraught. She spoke to him like a mother would. She could see the
                little boy in him through the grown man exterior; she loved that about Elmer. My family will forever
                be grateful to Elmer for what he did for James last year. We all have no doubt he was instrumental
                in getting James safely to Dakar! I had the priveledge of seeing their relationship develop starting in
                October 2005. I spent a lot of hours with them in the basement as they prepared in various ways for the
                adventure of James' life and his dream of Dakar. Elmer talked through situations with James; sharing his
                knowledge ofwhat it is like on this ralley. I know that James learned a lot from Elmer and that he had
                a love and bond with Elmer because of that experience. I believe they did impact each others lives.
                I'm not sure I can articulate the comfort and peace that we all felt knowing Elmer was caring for James
                in the most harsh and dangerous environment of the Dakar Ralley. We will never forget that and we will
                never forget Elmer. Elmer was loved by so many. I hope over the next few weeks and months that you are
                able to experience all the love that people had for him. Elmer definitely made his mark here on this
                earth
                and we all trust and believe that even though he left us sooner than he or any of us wanted that he is
                with
                your mother and father and Jesus in that peaceful place-Heaven. <br> <br>

                Philip, James wanted me to give you his phone number as he knows you could not write it down earlier. He
                said
                to please call him when time and energy permits. We are all here to support you and the family in any
                way that
                we can. His int'l cell phone number is 678-982-0466. <br> <br>

                I know that at a time like this there must be so much to think about and handle. I know of no other way
                to bring
                it up but to say I thought of some things that hopefully will be helpful at this time. <br> <br>

                We continue to pray for the Peace of God that surpasses ALL understanding to touch and heal your broken
                heart
                and as we reflect on the impact Elmer had on our lives here we rejoice that we had the opportunity to
                know him. <br> <br>

                May you know God's blessings, his peace, his power and strength to get you through this time or sorrow.
                <br> <br>

                Love, <br>

            <p>Hi Philip <br> <br>

                My deepest condolences on the death of your brother. I myself race Off Road motorcycles. I had a brother
                who raced Off Road
                with me but was unfortunately killed in a Superbike accident 2 years ago, so I have some understanding
                of how you must feel.
                Stay strong and remember your brother was and still is a great motivation to a lot of riders out there.
                I plan to ride the
                roof this year and will dedicate my finishing this event to Elmer. <br> <br>

                All the best <br>

                Your brother was not only a friend, but a fellow club member of Rovers MC and racer in District 37. I am

                I am stunned and saddened by the loss of Elmer. Please know he was loved and respected by all who knew

                Hi, <br> <br>

                I had the pleasure to meet Elmer in Muenster, Texas. He was practicing for the Last Man Standing event
                in December, 2006.
                I was riding with some fellow KTM friends and met Elmer and his partner Brian, I believe. We camped out
                with them and did
                some trail riding the next day. Elmer was very friendly to me and my wife Christie. I will remember him
                and his smile for
                quite some time. I was impressed with his riding skills, but his personality really showed. God bless
                the family and friends
                and I hope you will hang on the memories as we all will do. <br> <br>

                With sympathy, <br>

                To the family of Elmer Symons, <br> <br>

                My name is Candace Weaver, I had the pleasure of meeting Elmer last month at the Red Bull's Last Man
                Standing race in Bulcher , TX.
                Bart Hayes with Powersport Grafx had given him a ride out there, Bart is a friend of ours. After the
                race everyone was at the I-Hop
                getting a bite to eat, and he was talking about racing the Dakar. We are in shock and devastated at the
                news. Please know that your
                family are in our prayers. After looking at all the forums, I believe he touched so many lives. I know
                that he touched mine and Ken's. <br> <br>

                Philip, <br> <br>

                My name is Christy Warren and I live in Bauxite, Arkansas. My family and I would like to extend our
                thoughts to you at this difficult time. Elmer came
                to Arkansas and did a class and my husband and son attended it. They adored him and have talked of him
                everyday since they met him. It means a lot to
                me that he was such a great rider and competitor obviously well on his way to the top and took time out
                of his training to help some amateurs learn more
                about riding. He took special time with my son Justin who is 11 and was the only kid at the class and
                that really means a lot. Elmer really motivated
                Justin to train hard and have fun too! He just started riding in December of 2005 and he has already
                accomplished so much. He started racing in the
                middle of the series and he ended up placing fourth overall in his class. Justin and my husband Scott
                proudly hung their posters Elmer autographed for
                them and they are now even more precious to them than ever. He will forever be an influence in their
                riding and life. It's not every day that you get
                to meet someone who is as nice, special as well as talented as Elmer and I just wanted to let you know
                that he will be missed here by many. Our thoughts
                and prayers are with you and your family at this difficult time and we will continue to remember you for
                many days to come. <br> <br>

                Sincerely, <br>
                Christy Warren

                Oh my, he was so happy to be doing this, so grateful to you that you helped him achieve this goal, we
                talked about it the day he left the states.
                I am so sad to have lost this friend, I can only imagine the grief you must feel. I keep thinking it
                just can't be true, that there is some horrible mistake.
                If there is anything we can do, can help with, please let Malcolm or Troy or I know.
                We will do our best to help.
                Elmer was such a blessing in my life. He often spoke of the influence you had in making him the man he
                was. Thank you for that.
                He is loved and will be sorely missed. <br> <br>

                I am strucken with a loss for words right now. Elmer was a true friend to me and I would have done
                anything for him and without
                a doubt he would return the favor. During the time spent with Elmer I felt like we became pretty close.
                I will never forget
                about Elmer and I will continue to tell people of him. Please contact me some how e-mail

                Dear Philip and Jualeen, <br> <br>

                You dont know me but I am one of the many many people whos life was touched by meeting your Brother. I
                am very sad to be writing to you under these
                circumstances and would like to offer you my sincerest, heartfelt apologies for the tragedy that you
                have suffered on this day. The world is a Dakar
                place with the passing of Elmer. He will not be forgotten. My prayers are with Elmer and you all. My
                deepest condolences to you all.
                Elmer was a one of a kind individual. A top notch, class act person. One of the very few people that I
                have ever met, who impressed me in such a way.
                He gave his time ad self unselfishly to all who were around him. He took 2 days out of his training time
                for Last Man Standing to ride with a bunch
                of no-bodys from Arkansas. That is how I came to know him and how I will always remember him. God speed
                my brother. May God be with you all, family and friends. <br> <br>

                Hi Philip, <br> <br>

                Firstly I'd like to send my condolences to you and your family. I am really sorry to hear the news about
                Elmer.
                I live in the UK and have been here since 1999. Whenever the DAKAR was televised I would often think of
                you and Elmer.
                It looks like he really did super well in his career. <br> <br>

                Dear Philip <br> <br>

                Please accept my deepest sympathy, and know that you are in my prayers. A tragic and shocking loss.
                Elmer was my age and I
                cannot stop thinking about how close to home this feels to me and I have never met him or you.
                I remember looking at Elmer's site last week thinking that I would like to be able to attempt the Dakar
                one day too, and
                respecting everything Elmer has achieved.
                Please advise on where the funeral will be, If I cannot be there at least I could spare a moment of
                silence for a real hero. <br> <br>
